# World_Weather_Analysis

Used OpenWeather API to export weather data and Google APIs to map an Itinerary for a vacation. The map API was used to find close hotels to each city and find directions to and from four selected cities. The cities were chosen based on the export weather data by filtering the max and min temperatures.
